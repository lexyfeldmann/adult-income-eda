# **Adult Income Exploratory Analysis**


**Project Overview**

This notebook explores the Adult Income dataset to better understand which demographic and work-related factors are most associated with earning above or below $50K annually. The dataset includes features such as age, education, occupation, marital status, work hours, and native country. I began by loading and inspecting the data, checking for missing values, and cleaning any inconsistencies. Initial exploratory data analysis focused on understanding distributions, spotting potential outliers, and identifying relationships between categorical and numerical variables. The primary goal was to uncover trends that could be valuable for both descriptive insights and future predictive modeling.

**Methods & Results**

I used descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore how income levels vary across factors like education, occupation, and work hours per week. Grouped bar charts, histograms, and boxplots revealed clear patterns â€” for example, higher education levels and certain occupations are strongly correlated with earning above $50K, while work hours showed a noticeable upward trend in income past a certain threshold. Correlation heatmaps helped identify key numerical relationships, and categorical breakdowns highlighted which groups tend to have higher income potential. This EDA laid a solid foundation for identifying the most influential features in predicting income brackets.

**Key Outputs**

- Cleaned and structured Adult Income dataset for analysis
- Visualizations showing income distribution across demographics and occupations
- Correlation heatmaps to highlight important numerical relationships
- Category-based insights for education, occupation, and marital status
- Summary statistics for both continuous and categorical variables

**Conclusion**

Overall, this notebook provides a clear breakdown of the factors influencing income levels in the dataset. The findings can be used as a starting point for building predictive models or guiding workforce and education-related strategies. By understanding which characteristics are most associated with higher earnings, we can better target training programs, policy development, and career guidance initiatives.
